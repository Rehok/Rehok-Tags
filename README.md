##### Explaining the Tags

Current tags format it to be 2 decimal places if its above 1 million otherwise it will display the actual number e.g 1,10,100,1k,10k,100k,1.01m

Percent Tags format it to a whole number if above 1 e.g 56 without a % sign if its below 1 it will display 0.x as the number

Current and Percent together display it same as above 2 but with a | in between them e.g 1.01m | 98

Name tag currently formats it to A.B.Charlie. e.g Argus the Unmaker will be formatted to A.T.Unmaker
